# Intro_Deep_Learning

I'm taking "Introduction to Deep Learning with PyTorch" lecture from Udacity. 
This repository includes my notes & codes from this lecture. I also take screenshots to remember the concepts easily.
There are also some useful links and my own notes. 

I would like to thank Udacity to give us opportunity to reach this course free:)

The outline of the repository

1. [common](https://github.com/pelinbalci/Intro_Deep_Learning/tree/master/common) 
This folder includes common scripts which are used for the entire project. 

2. [Intro_NN](https://github.com/pelinbalci/Intro_Deep_Learning/tree/master/Intro_NN) 
Introduction to Neural Networks. Before using the torch modules it is useful to understand the maths behind gradients,
 perceptron, regularization. I also add some of my handwritten notes not to forget the derivatives :)

3. [Intro_Pytorch_Lecture](https://github.com/pelinbalci/Intro_Deep_Learning/tree/master/Intro_Pytorch_Lecture) 
Learn how to develeop a neural network with PyTorch.
Mnist Data Set, Mnist Fashion Data Set and Cat & Dog images are used for classification. 

4. [MLP](https://github.com/pelinbalci/Intro_Deep_Learning/tree/master/MLP) 
This is a recap for MLP. You can find complete classification code for Mnist dataset and analysis of these codes.

5. [CNN](https://github.com/pelinbalci/Intro_Deep_Learning/tree/master/CNN) 

6. [RNN]https://github.com/pelinbalci/Intro_Deep_Learning/tree/master/RNN)
