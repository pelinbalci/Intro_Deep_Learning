# Intro_Deep_Learning

I'm taking "Introduction to Deep Learning with PyTorch" lecture from Udacity. 
This repository includes my notes & codes from this lecture. I also take screenshots to remember the concepts easily.
There are also some useful links and my own notes. 

I would like to thank Udacity to give us oppotunity to reach this course free:)

The outline of the repository

1. Intro_NN 
2. Intro_Pytorch_Lecture
3. CNN
4. common

The details:

1. Intro_NN 
Notes: perceptron, cross_entropy, gradients, overfitting
Codes: small scripts about this topics. 

2. Intro_Pytorch_Lecture
Learn how to develeop a neural network with PyTorch.
Mnist Data Set, Mnist Fashion Data Set and Cat & Dog images are used for classification. 

3. CNN
The first part is a recap for MLP. You can find complete classification code for Mnist dataset and analysis of these codes. 

4. common
This folder includes common scripts which are used for the entire project.
