# Intro_Deep_Learning

I'm taking "Introduction to Deep Learning with PyTorch" lecture from Udacity. I've also watched the videos of cs231n 
from Standford University from Youtube for CNN. 

This repository includes my notes & codes from these lecture. I also take screenshots to remember the concepts easily.
There are also some useful links and my own notes. 

I would like to thank Udacity & Standford University to give us opportunity to reach these course free:)

The outline of the repository

1. [common](https://github.com/pelinbalci/Intro_Deep_Learning/tree/master/common) 
This folder includes common scripts which are used for the entire project. 

2. [Intro_NN](https://github.com/pelinbalci/Intro_Deep_Learning/tree/master/Intro_NN) 
Introduction to Neural Networks. Before using the torch modules it is useful to understand the maths behind gradients,
 perceptron, regularization. I also add some of my handwritten notes not to forget the derivatives :)

3. [Intro_Pytorch_Lecture](https://github.com/pelinbalci/Intro_Deep_Learning/tree/master/Intro_Pytorch_Lecture) 
Learn how to develeop a neural network with PyTorch.
Mnist Data Set, Mnist Fashion Data Set and Cat & Dog images are used for classification. 

4. [MLP](https://github.com/pelinbalci/Intro_Deep_Learning/tree/master/MLP) 
This is a recap for MLP. You can find complete classification code for Mnist dataset and analysis of these codes.

5. [CNN](https://github.com/pelinbalci/Intro_Deep_Learning/tree/master/CNN) 
- Filtering, visualization, cifar-10-images
- You may find the assignments for knn, svm, softmax, gradient from the lecture cs231n from Standford University

6. [RNN](https://github.com/pelinbalci/Intro_Deep_Learning/tree/master/RNN) 
Includes, text prediction, time series analysis.
